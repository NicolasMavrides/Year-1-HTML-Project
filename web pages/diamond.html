		<h1>The Diamond</h1>

			class="module_pics" align= "right" width="180px" height="120px"/></a>
		
			<p> The Diamond is Sheffield's newest campus building. It was opened in
			September 2015 with the aim to provide labs, study spaces and lecture theatres
			to the Engineering Faculty's students, and hence has become known as the 
			Engineering building.</p>
		
		<h3>Ground Floor and Basement</h3>
			<p> The building itself is accessible to all students and staff of the
			University of Sheffield, even though only the Engineering-related courses
			hold lectures there. As my course is part of the Engineering faculty, this
			is where I have my lectures and spend most of my time working at.
			The ground floor includes a cafeteria space and stairs which lead either
			to the basement level to the lecture theatres, or upstairs to Floors 1-4
			where all the labs and study spaces are. 
			</p>

		<h3>Upper floors</h3>
		
			<p> The upper floors are only accessible to
			students and staff due to barriers on Floor 1 which require a Ucard to 
			pass through.
		
		<h4>Labs</h4>
		
		<a href="../images/open-study-areas.jpg"><img src="../images/open-study-areas.jpg" 
		class="module_pics" align= "right" width="180px" height="120px"/></a>
		
		<p> Floor 1 largely consists of an open study area with plenty of seating areas
		and tables to work at. A number of Biology labs are also present on Floor 1
		for the Biology and Chemistry departments.

		class="module_pics" align= "left" width="180px" height="120px"/></a>
		
		"Danger Lab" sessions, which demonstrate precautions to be taken while 
		working, are also held in these labs for students of all Engineering
		courses, Computer Science included. Computer Rooms are present on the 
		second floor in which all of my lab sessions for my course take place.</p>

		<h4>Silent Study and Group Meeting Rooms</h4>
		
		<p> Silent Study areas and group meeting rooms are available on the third
		and fourth floors. Group meeting rooms can be booked by any member of the
		university in advance.</p>

		<p> In addition, a reception for the IT Help Service is available on the
		fourth floor, from which equipment such as laptops can be borrowed for use. </p>
